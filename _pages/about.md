Welcome to my homepage! I am Tianxiang Zhao, an Assistant Professor in the AI thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), starting from February 2026. Prior to joining HKUST(GZ), I worked as an LLM Researcher at Huawei through the TopMinds (天才少年) program in 2025. I received my Ph.D. in 2024 from the Pennsylvania State University, where I was co-advised by Prof. Xiang Zhang and Prof. Suhang Wang.



## Research
My research focuses on data-centric machine learning. Recently, my interests include the following directions:
- Data Efficiency in Machine Learning: 
    - Learning from imperfect supervison (e.g., noisy or unlabeled data);
    - Imitation learning and on-policy knowledge distillation.
- Efficiency of Vision-Language models in reasoning, optimization of agentic systems
- Trustworthy in Machine Learning:
    - Model debias
    - Explanablity approaches for understanding model behaviors and learning dynamics
I am broadly interested in topics related to machine learning and cross-disciplinary applications. Feel free to email me if you’d like to connect.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am looking for 2–3 PhD students to start in Fall 2026, and also have openings for Interns/Research Assistants at the moment. If you are interested, please send your resume/CV to me.</span>
